* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	A unique platform on Chime app, where the customer can get easier approval and everything online, all the contracts submissions online. 
This platform would be linked with data base from other banks and institutions to determine how much money and guaranties this user would be approved. For mortgages for example they would also be by the method of share equity process. Where the buyers would either repay the borrowed money in a number of years, or when selling the house a proportional percentage of selling amount would go to Chime.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	As their customer are mostly low credit profile, the risk of lending money is higher. So, Chime would need some guaranties like a platform that pulls data base from other banks and institutions, to determine how much this user would be approved and how they could pay.
